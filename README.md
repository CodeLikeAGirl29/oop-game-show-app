## Phrase Hunter
This game is all about guessing a random phrase, from a predifined list of five phrases, before making five wrong guesses.

On screen and physical keyboard input
Users can choose how they want to interact with the game and even switch during the game. While playing the game will ignore choices that already have been made.

Conditional user feedback
If the user makes a wrong guess they will be proved with three kinds of feedback:

One life is lost.
Remaining letters start pulsing (speed depends on lives left).
A game over screen with the correct phrase when five lives are lost.
A game over screen with the amount of lives left and the guessed phrase will be shown when the user wins the game.
